# mdv2
Processing code for multi-distance hybrid broadband-fdpm (DOSI) measurements

Ingests measurement files generated at multiple source-detector separations on the surface of a homogeneous slab (usually a PDMS or liquid optical phantom), and outputs the optical properties of said slab.

Acceptable input files are *.asc files, which are TSV files generated by the frequency domain and broadband instrument control programs we use (primarily LBS, mDOSI, HBS systems).

The program's entry point is mrhoscript.m

This is research-quality (read: not good) code, on display for an indeterminate amount of time. If you find it useful for some reason, please let me know! Unless you're from my lab--in that case, I probably know already.

Released under a CRAPL license, unless I figure out something better.
